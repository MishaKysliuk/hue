Hue service integration is generic and lets you integrate with other analytics systems. Here is a list of the main APIs:

* Connect or create SQL connectors to any Database
* List any files from any filesytem
* List any job or query list
* Integrate with a Data Catalog

REST APIs are not all public yet but this is work in progress in [HUE-1450](https://issues.cloudera.org/browse/HUE-1450).
Upcoming APIs: how to add new vizualizations, new SQL grammar and highlighting, workflow systems.
In addition, whole new apps can also be created in order to provide end to end solutions.
